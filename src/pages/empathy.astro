				We conducted an experiment with a unique . The control setup was
				the tens of DTL forms that were being released everyday.
			</p>
			<p>
				We created a form similar to most other DTL forms - with a fancy
				idea and AI generated caption. The difference was that we
				included the name of the recipient in the email, and personally
				addressed them.

			<p>
				Several people responded asking how we personally addressed
				them, as they usually just got cold emails. This was a good sign
				that our personalization was working.
