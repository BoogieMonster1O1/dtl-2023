			Problems revealed by the survey

		<div class="flex flex-col gap-4 mt-8 max-w-screen-md">
			<p>- Students cannot use mail merge services</p>
			<p>- Students cannot send rich, HTML emails easily</p>
			<p>- Mass emails have a lack of personalization</p>
			<p>- DTL surveys received lower-than-expected response rates</p>
			<p>- DTL emails sometimes went to spam</p>
			<p>
				- Content in mass emails is not properly humanized and sounds
				AI-generated
			</p>
			<p>- Personally sending emails is not scalable</p>
