				The problem we aim to address is the limited reach and lack of impressions
				created from traditional, mass, cold emails.
			</p>
			<p>
				Students have been sending DTL forms en-masse with little to no personalization.
				This is influenced due to sociological and psychological factors. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Our hypothesis is that a little personalization can go a long way in creating
				a lasting impression and increasing the response rate.
			</p>
			<p>
				Traditional mail-merge software does not integrate well with our campus
				infrastructure, and we are looking to create a custom solution.

			Initial Experiment
		</h2>

		<div class="flex flex-col gap-4 mt-8 max-w-screen-md">
			<p>
				Our first experiment was to test how a simple personalization - including the name
				of the recipient in the email - affected response rate. The control setup was the 
				tens of DTL forms that were being released everyday.
			</p>
			<p>
				We created a form similar to most other DTL forms - with a fancy idea and AI generated
				caption. The difference was that we included the name of the recipient in the email, and
				personally addressed them.

			<p>
				Several people responded asking how we personally addressed them, as they usually
				just got cold emails. This was a good sign that our personalization was working.

			Current Methodology
		</h2>

		<div class="flex flex-col gap-4 mt-8 max-w-screen-md">
			<p>
				Collecting user responses online will <b>not</b> be a part of our methodology.
				Since our project itself is about email surveys, we do not believe that they are
				a feasible method to collect feedback and user responses.
			</p>
			<p>
				All interviews will be conducted in-person.
